# Homework-and-final-project-in-Data-Mining-course

Homework 1 is movie review classification implement the Nearest Neighbor classification algorithm.
Homework 2 handle the unbalanced data with oversampling in part 1 and handle categorical features with OneHotEncoder in part 2. It implements Random Forest Classifier to do the product rating prediction in part 1 and implements Decision Tree Classifier to do the criminal recidivism prediction in part 2.
Homework 3 discuss the bias by comparing false positive rates and calibration, implementing 5-fold cross-validation.
Homework 4 do Iris Clustering implementing the K-means algorithm in part 1 and do Image Clustering implementing the K-means algorithm.
Final Project is the cost sensitive learning in 1998 KDD cup. It requires to design methods entirely on the learning and training dataset to get the best performance in the final test on the validation dataset. Our final solution includes: Data cleaning of Noisy Data; Dimentionality Reduction; Model selection; Design of the model of high value donations; discussing the performance of either model or combination of the models.
