How to run the code:

1. Open the python file "final_part1_code.py" and "final_part2_code.py". Run the file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some explanations for other file in the folder:
(1) "Iris_Test_data.txt" file is the test dataset of part 1 downloaded from miner.
     "Image_Test.txt" file is the test dataset of part 2 downloaded from miner.

(2) "part1_label.txt" and "part2_label.txt" is the labels return by Kmeans classifier and used to submit on the miner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
where my kmeans implementation is:
I both show my Kmeans implementation at the start of "final_part1_code.py" and "final_part2_code.py".
The classes Kmeans are both the same in these two code files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some other information:
(1) There are comments for every part of my code so it is easy to understand what I want to do in every part.
(2) The "final_part1_code.py" file will return "final_part1_code.py" and a distribution graph of all data points and all clustering center.
     The "final_part2_code.py" file will return "final_part2_code.py", "The graph of 10000 data points' distribution and 10 clustering centers" and "k - wss relation graph". k is the value k of Kmeans, wss is short for "within cluster sum of squares".
