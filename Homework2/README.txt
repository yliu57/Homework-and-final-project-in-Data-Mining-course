How to run the code:

1. Replace the "test_A.csv" and "test_B.csv" with the new test dataset files 
and pay attention to keep the same names, which are "test_A.csv" and "test_B.csv", to be the file names of the new test dataset csv files.

2. Open the python file "Yuxi_PartA_final_code.py" and "Yuxi_PartB_final_code.py". Run the file.

Some explanations for other files in the folder:
(1) "train_A.csv" and "train_B.csv" are the original csv file in training dataset downloaded from miner2 website.
(2) "partA_label_predict" and  "partB_label_predict" are the examples of the final result run by my python file "Yuxi_PartA_final_code.py" or "Yuxi_PartB_final_code.py".
      Every time of running will replace the previous output in the file ("partA_label_predict" or  "partB_label_predict") and output the new results to this file.

Some other information:
(1) There are comments for every part of my code so it is easy to understand what I want to do in every part.
